				Today, Trimurti Father Shiva is especially seeing all His 
				children in three relationships. The first most loving 
				relationship is that of your being the masters of all 
				attainments, the heirs. As well as being heirs you are Godly 
				students and, together with that, you are those who are loved by 
				the Satguru because you follow at every step. Trimurti Father 
				Shiva is seeing the children especially in these three 
				relationships. In fact, you are the souls who have the 
				experience of fulfilling the responsibility of all 
				relationships, but today, Baba is especially seeing the three 
				relationships. Everyone loves these three relationships. Today, 
				all of you have come running here with enthusiasm in order to 
				celebrate Trimurti Shiv Jayanti. Have you come to give 
				congratulations to the Father or have you come to receive 
				congratulations from the Father? What would you say? You have 
				come to do both. Since the very name is Shiv Jayanti and Shiv 
				Ratri, what does Trimurti prove? What does He do through 
				Prajapita Brahma? He creates the creation of you Brahmins. You 
				are then sustained. So the word Trimurti proves that together 
				with the Father there are also you Brahmin souls. What would the 
				Father do by Himself? This is why the birthday of the Father 
				also means the birthday of you Brahmin children. This is why 
				Baba is giving you children multimillionfold congratulations for 
				this alokik, divine birth, the diamond birth. Your letters and 
				cards of congratulations have already reached the Father, and, 
				even now, many children are singing songs of congratulations 
				from their heart. Whether they are far away or whether they are 
				personally in front of Baba, Baba can hear in His ears, the 
				songs of congratulations, even from those who are far away. In 
				return, BapDada is giving multimillionfold congratulations to 
				the children of this land and of foreign lands.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; punctuation-wrap: simple; line-height: 200%; margin-left: 5.95pt; margin-right: 5.35pt; margin-top: 7.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
				<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 16pt" color="#000080">
				All of you children know that to celebrate any festival in 
				Brahmin life means to create an elevated life constantly filled 
				with zeal and enthusiasm. In the alokik dictionary of Brahmins, 
				to celebrate means to become. So, will you simply celebrate the 
				festival today, or will you create a life constantly filled with 
				zeal and enthusiasm? You have a life when there is breath in 
				that physical body. What would your life be if your breath 
				finished? It would be finished. So, too, the breath of Brahmin 
				life is constant zeal and enthusiasm. In Brahmin life, if there 
				isn't zeal and enthusiasm at every second, then that is not 
				Brahmin life. However, the speed of your breathing should also 
				be normal. If the breathing is very fast, then that is not a 
				normal life and if it is slow, then too, it would not be called 
				a normal life. You either have high pressure or low pressure. So 
				that would not be called a normal life. So, here, too, check: Is 
				the speed of the zeal and enthusiasm of my Brahmin life normal? 
				Or, is it sometimes very fast and sometimes very slow? Or, does 
				it remain constant? It should be constant, should it not? If it 
				is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, that is not good. This is 
				why every moment of the confluence age is a festivity. You 
				specially celebrate a special day for your entertainment 
				because, in Brahmin life, where else would you go for 
				entertainment? You would only entertain yourself here, would you 
				not? You would not especially go to the seaside or to a park or 
				to a club, would you? The seaside, the park and the club are all 
				here. This Brahmin club is good, is it not? So, the breath of 
				Brahmin life is zeal and enthusiasm. So your breathing is 
				normal, is it not? Or does it fluctuate? So BapDada continues to 
				check each child. He does not have to check with a stethoscope 
				in His ears. Nowadays, science has made everything automatic.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; punctuation-wrap: simple; line-height: 200%; margin-left: 5.95pt; margin-right: 5.35pt; margin-top: 7.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
				<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 16pt" color="#000080">
				Shiv Ratri or Shiv Jayanti: you know the significance of both 
				very clearly, do you not? You can also tell others, can you not? 
				You know the significance of both and you are also able to tell 
				others about it clearly. Together with the birthday of the 
				Father, it is also the birthday of you children. So you can 
				relate the significance of your own birthday, can you not? The 
				memorials that the devotees celebrate are also with a lot of 
				love and devotion. However, the difference is that they hold a 
				fast on Shiv Ratri every year whereas you have a picnic. As soon 
				as you take birth, all of you have a fast just once for all 
				time, that is, for the entire Brahmin life. This is why you do 
				not have to fast again and again. They have to fast every year 
				whereas you Brahmin souls have made a vow for this: that from 
				the moment you took birth, you would remain constantly perfect 
				and complete like the father. You have made this firm vow, have 
				you not? Or, is it a little weak? Since the relationship between 
				the soul and the Supreme Soul is eternal, what should the vow 
				be? It should be eternal, should it not? So the people of the 
				world simply have a fast of their food and drink. What does this 
				show? You have made a vow in your Brahmin life for your food and 
				drink for all time, have you not? Or, are you free to do what 
				you want? That you can eat or drink whatever you want? No. Have 
				you made the vow firm? Or, do you break your vow when you become 
				tired? If you sometimes do not have any time, is it that you 
				should get something from outside and eat that? Do you sometimes 
				become slack in fulfilling your vow? Look, your devotees hold a 
				fast, even if it is once a year, but still follow that code of 
				conduct. Since your devotees are firm in their fast, how firm 
				should you be? Are you firm? Or, do you sometimes become slack? 
				&quot;It doesn't matter if we offer bhog tomorrow and not today.&quot; So 
				this is a memorial of your unlimited fast in the life of you 
				Brahmin souls.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; punctuation-wrap: simple; line-height: 200%; margin-left: 5.95pt; margin-right: 5.35pt; margin-top: 7.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
				<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 16pt" color="#000080">
				On this day especially, they also make a vow of purity. Firstly, 
				they make a vow of purity and, secondly, they make a vow 
				regarding their food and drink. Thirdly, they never give any 
				type of sorrow to anyone or deceive anyone in any way throughout 
				the whole day. They also make that vow. However, the vow of your 
				Brahmin life is unlimited, whereas theirs is for one day. So you 
				imbibed the vow of purity in Brahmin life as soon as you took 
				birth, did you not? Purity is not just celibacy, but the vow of 
				purity is to attain victory over the five vices. This is called 
				the vow of purity. So, check to what extent you are successful 
				in your vow of purity. Just as you pay special attention to 
				celibacy, that is, to conquering the greatest enemy, lust, in 
				the same way, do you also pay the same attention to conquering 
				the four companions of lust, the greatest enemy? Or, do you 
				allow yourself some freedom for that? That it does not matter if 
				you become a little angry? Do you allow yourself that freedom? 
				You are not allowed it, but you allow yourself that freedom. It 
				has been seen that you give freedom to the children of anger. 
				You have chased away the great evil spirit of anger, but you 
				still have love for its children. Just as little children are 
				loved very much, so too, the little children of anger are 
				sometimes loved very much. So a vow means a vow of complete 
				purity. Many children tell Baba many very good things. They say: 
				I did not become angry, but I was made angry, so what can I do? 
				I did not become angry, but what can I do if others make me 
				angry? They say something very entertaining. They say: If You 
				had been there at that time, You too would have become angry. So 
				what would BapDada say: BapDada says: Achcha, you are forgiven, 
				but do not do it in future.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; punctuation-wrap: simple; line-height: 200%; margin-left: 5.95pt; margin-right: 5.35pt; margin-top: 7.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
				<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 16pt" color="#000080">
				Shiv Ratri means to finish the darkness of the night and to 
				bring the light. It means the rise of the master suns of 
				knowledge. This is Shiv Ratri. So you are those in this world 
				who become the master suns of knowledge, who finish the darkness 
				and bring about light. So what would those who bring light into 
				the world be themselves? They would not be in darkness, would 
				they? You are not like little lamps. There is darkness below the 
				little lamps and light above them. You are master suns of 
				knowledge. So a master sun of knowledge is himself the form of 
				light and might and also gives light and might to others. So 
				where there is constant light, there is no question of darkness&#894; 
				there cannot be any darkness. So, complete purity means light. 
				Darkness cannot remain with those souls who dispel darkness. Can 
				there be any darkness? Can darkness come to you? OK, it may not 
				remain, but does it come to you and then go away. Is this 
				possible? If there is the slightest trace of any vice, would you 
				call that light or darkness? So there isn't any darkness, is 
				there? It has finished, has it not? You show the picture of Shiv 
				Ratri, do you not? What do you show in the picture? That the 
				darkness is being dispelled. Or, does a little still remain? 
				What will you especially do on this Shiv Ratri? Will you do 
				anything or will you just hoist a flag? What will you do? Will 
				you just make a promise as you do every year, &quot;I will not do 
				this, I will not do that&quot;, and then do that? It is not like 
				that, is it? You were also told earlier that a promise means 
				that even if you die the promise should not be broken. No matter 
				what you have to renounce, no matter what you have to hear, your 
				promise should not be broken. It should not be that when there 
				are no problems, your promise is fine, but when any problems 
				come, the problem becomes powerful and your promise becomes 
				weak. That is not called a promise. A promise means a promise. 
				So you should make a promise with your mind, not just in words. 
				Those who make a promise because of others asking them to, have 
				a powerful thought at that time. Those who make a promise when 
				others ask them to have power, but not all powers. You make a 
				promise in your mind, and to whom do you make it? To the Father. 
				To make a promise to the Father and to make it with your mind 
				means to make the mind Manmanabhav. This mantra of Manmanabhav 
				then constantly becomes the weapon for any situation. However, 
				this will happen when you make it with the mind. It should enter 
				your mind: &quot;I must not do this.” If there is a thought in the 
				mind: &quot;I will try, I have to do it. I have to become. What will 
				happen if I don't do it like this&#894; what will I do? That is why I 
				had better do it.&quot; This is then known as a little bit of 
				compulsion. Those who do it with the mind will never think: &quot;It 
				has to be done, it must be done.&quot; They will think that the 
				Father has said it and so it is certain that it has already 
				happened. This is the promise of those who are the first number 
				whereas the promise of the second number is: We have to become, 
				we have to do it, but we don't know when it will happen. It 
				means that those who think &quot;If, if&quot; have become parrots. BapDada 
				has the complete file of how many times each one has made a 
				promise. The files have become very thick. You must no longer 
				compile a file, but make it final. When someone says to BapDada, 
				&quot;Let us make everyone write a note of their promise&quot;, the whole 
				file emerges in front of BapDada. Do you still want to do this? 
				Do you still want to add papers to your file? Or, will you make 
				a final promise?</font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; punctuation-wrap: simple; line-height: 200%; margin-left: 5.95pt; margin-right: 5.35pt; margin-top: 7.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
				<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 16pt" color="#000080">
				BapDada saw one main reason for a weak promise. That one word 
				comes up in many different royal forms and it makes you weak. So 
				this one word is one of body consciousness, &quot;I&quot;. This word &quot;I&quot; 
				deceives you. &quot;I think this&quot;, &quot;I can do this&quot;, &quot;But only I can 
				do this&quot;, &quot;What I said was right&quot;, &quot;What I thought was right&quot;. 
				So this &quot;I&quot; in different royal forms makes your promise weak. 
				Eventually, you become weak and have thoughts of hopelessness: 
				&quot;I cannot tolerate so much&quot;, &quot;I can't do so much that I can make 
				myself completely humble&quot;, &quot;I can't listen to so much&quot;, &quot;I can't 
				overcome so many difficulties&quot;, &quot;It is difficult&quot;. This kind of 
				consciousness of &quot;I&quot; makes you weak. There are many good royal 
				forms. However, look in your own life to see to what extent this 
				consciousness of &quot;I&quot; comes up in the form of your sanskars, in 
				the form of your nature, in the form of your feelings, in the 
				form of your motives, in the form of your words, in the form of 
				your relationships and connections. And they do come up in a 
				very sweet form. At Shiv Ratri, there is the sacrifice of this 
				&quot;I, I&quot;. The poor devotees offer the sacrifice of a goat that 
				bleats, &quot;meh, meh&quot;, but it is this &quot;I, I&quot;. Sacrifice this. They 
				celebrate the memorial of all of you in a different way. Have 
				you sacrificed this, or does a little of the consciousness of 
				&quot;I&quot; still remain to be sacrificed? What is the result? Have you 
				sacrificed it already? Since there is love for the Father, 
				everyone has passed in the subject of love. Will any of you say 
				that you have 75% love or 50% love? When it comes to love, all 
				of you would say that you have more than 100% love. The Father 
				also says: You are those who have true love and that you have 
				passed in this. What is renunciation when there is love? Make a 
				promise with your mind and let it be a determined promise. Check 
				yourself again and again. Is the examination powerful or is the 
				promise powerful? Because, one examination or another weakens 
				your promise.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; punctuation-wrap: simple; line-height: 200%; margin-left: 5.95pt; margin-right: 5.35pt; margin-top: 7.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
				<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 16pt" color="#000080">
				The double foreigners are clever in making a promise, are they 
				not? You are not clever in breaking, but you are clever in 
				connecting. BapDada smiles on seeing the fortune of all the 
				double­foreign children. You have recognised the Father and this 
				is the biggest wonder of all. The second wonder is that, 
				although you are part of the variety of branches of the tree, 
				you have become the branches of the sandalwood tree of the one 
				Father. You are now all the branches of the one tree. You have 
				brought about oneness in the variety. The countries are 
				different, the languages are different, the cultures are 
				different, but you have brought about unity within the variety. 
				What is the culture of everyone now? It is Brahmin culture. 
				Never say, &quot;Our foreign culture says this.&quot; Or, that the people 
				of Bharat say, &quot;Our culture of Bharat is like this&quot;. It is not 
				Indian or foreign, but it is Brahmin culture. Unity within the 
				variety is the wonder. What other wonder have you performed? 
				Since you belonged to the Father, you made all the different 
				varieties of customs and systems and the timetable the same. 
				Whether you are in America or whether you are in London, 
				wherever you are, the timetable of Brahmins is the same. Or, is 
				it different? Is the timetable of the lands abroad different 
				from that of Bharat? Is it like this? No, it is the same. 
				Renunciation of this difference is the wonder. Do you understand 
				what wonders you have performed? You sing about the Father that 
				He has performed wonders and the Father then sings of the 
				children that the children have performed wonders. BapDada is 
				pleased seeing you. Baba is pleased and you children dance in 
				happiness.</font></p>

				BapDada continues to hear about the service everywhere abroad 
				and this land. Both are racing ahead in service. All the 
				programmes have been very good and they will be even better in 
				the future. You used determined thoughts with determination, 
				that is, you used them in a worthwhile way. The more the 
				determined thoughts are used in a worthwhile way, the easier the 
				experience of success will be. Never think: How will this 
				happen? Instead of thinking &quot;How?&quot;, think &quot;This is how&quot;. There 
				is the special blessing at the confluence, of making the 
				impossible possible. So, there cannot be the word, &quot;How?&quot;&#894; “It 
				is difficult for this to happen.” No&#894; let there be the faith 
				that it is certain it has already happened. We simply have to 
				put it into practice. It has to repeat. It is already fixed, and 
				what is fixed has to be recreated, that is, it has to repeat. 
				This is known as the basis of easy success and it is to use the 
				treasure of determined thoughts in a worthwhile way. Do you 
				understand? Never think &quot;What will happen? How will it happen?&quot; 
				It will happen and it will happen easily. If there is upheaval 
				in your thoughts, it will bring about upheaval in your success. 
				Achcha.</font></p>
